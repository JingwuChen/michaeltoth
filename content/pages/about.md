Some of these are interesting side projects I'm exploring and some of them are solutions to challenging real-world problems that I've tackled at work. I hope they'll be helpful and interesting to you!

I'm super-excited about the value we're creating for customers (in fact, I was a customer before I was an employee), and feel privileged to work at a company that's shaking up the wireless industry.

Outside of work, I'm a happy husband, an active member of my local church, a frequent camper, and an avid racquetball player.
