Hi! My name is Michael Toth, and I'm a data scientist living in New York City.

I try to keep my blog updated with posts about data analysis, data visualization, and programming projects I'm working on. Some of these are interesting side projects I'm exploring and some of them are solutions to challenging real-world problems that I've tackled at work. I hope they'll be helpful and interesting to you!

I'm currently working at [Orchard](https://www.orchardplatform.com) as a data scientist. Orchard is a fintech startup in the online lending industry. I spend a lot of my time producing reproducible research reports on the industry, creating interesting data visualizations, building investment models, and serving as an analytical & data expert in communications with current & prospective clients. For a sample of some of the public work I've done at Orchard, be sure to check out the links on my [writing page]({filename}./writing.md)

Prior to Orchard I was working as a portfolio analyst at [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com) where I worked with large institutional investment clients to value and assess the risks of their investment portfolios.

I do the majority of my day-to-day work and analyses using R and *nix command-line tools, but I also have experience with the Python data science stack. I enjoy experimenting with different tools, and recently I've spent some time working with D3.js and Tableau, which I hope to do more of in the future.  

Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out in coffee shops, drinking craft beer, and playing squash and table tennis.

If you find any of my posts or projects interesting, definitely reach out! I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!
